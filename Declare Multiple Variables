To declare more than one variable of the same type, you can use a comma-separated list:
Instead of writing:
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);

You can simply write:
int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);

One Value to Multiple Variables
You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);
